        <p>My journey with UCF started at LSSC which is an affiliate with the University of Central Florida. I did full time dual enrollment for my last 2 years of school.</p>

        <h2>From HSCA to Engineering</h2>
        <img src="engineering.jpg" alt="Engineering" class="section-image">
        <p>Originally, I was in a program called HSCA which forced me to take classes related to the health field, but I quickly left the program and instead opted to work towards an engineering degree.</p>

        <h2>Switching to Digital Media</h2>
        <img src="digital-media.jpg" alt="Digital Media" class="section-image">
        <p>During my first year after being accepted into UCF I was an aerospace engineering major. The classes were fine, but I began to realize that I wasnâ€™t enjoying my time. During that time, however, I was exposed to coding and programming for the first time. I ended up taking courses in both python and in C programming. As the year came to an end I decided to transition from Engineering major to Digital Media because I feel like this major will allow me to learn to program while also introducing me to an industry I actually enjoy.</p>

        <h2>My PC</h2>
        <img src="pc.jpg" alt="PC" class="section-image">
        <p>During the past couple of years, I ended up building a PC for myself, one that could keep up with me in my time at college and help with my professional career. At the moment my PC is one of the most important things I own. I use it to code, to play games, to do tasks for me and everything in between. At the time my PC cost me about $1200 and it was honestly money well spent.
